# Stress Testing

Stress testing applies scenario multipliers to the three components of expected loss:

- PD multiplier
- LGD multiplier
- CCF multiplier for revolving-facility EAD

The default scenarios are:

| Scenario | PD | LGD | CCF |
|----------|----|-----|-----|
| base | 1.00x | 1.00x | 1.00x |
| mild | 1.25x | 1.10x | 1.10x |
| severe | 2.00x | 1.30x | 1.20x |

The stress output reports:

- total stressed EAD
- total stressed expected loss
- average stressed PD
- average stressed LGD
- change versus base
- percentage change versus base

This framing is enough to support interview discussion around downturn overlays, migration risk, and sensitivity of revolving products to adverse conditions.
